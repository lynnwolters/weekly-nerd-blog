                    <span class="text-white">Learning goals</span>
                    <br><br>
                    My initial learning goals for this project were to improve my planning skills, become comfortable with JavaScript, and implement accessibility. Unfortunately, I must admit that I made little progress on these goals. This was mainly because, as the lead designer, I was responsible for the most challenging task of the project: the design. I dedicated a lot of time to this. While I am very proud of the final design, it's disappointing that I didn't have time to work on my learning goals. This project could have been a perfect opportunity to focus on them.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="text-white">Reflection on the role as designer</span>
                    <br><br>
                    In my role as lead designer, I invested a lot of time and energy in the design process, resulting in a design I am very proud of. However, due to time constraints and my responsibilities as the lead designer, I had little room to pursue my personal learning goals. The client provided sufficient time and space, but being appointed as the lead designer made it difficult to concentrate on other matters.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="text-white">Collaboration and communication</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Regarding collaboration, I could have communicated better. I still find teamwork challenging due to different ways of thinking. I prefer to work everything out myself, but I should have communicated better to find a way to work through this. The time pressure and hectic nature contributed to overlooking this aspect. Nevertheless, I managed the project well and experienced what it's like to act as a project supervisor. This experience will help me improve in completing projects.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="text-white">Future improvements</span>
                    <br><br>
                    For future projects, I want to pay more attention to my learning goals and focus on them. I can achieve this by communicating better, letting go of the design more, and creating space for personal growth. I need to manage my time more consciously and divide tasks so I can also work on my own development.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="text-white">Conclusion</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Although I was unable to achieve my learning goals, I did rediscover my passion for design and gained valuable experience as a project supervisor. I will carry these insights into future projects, where I aim to improve my communication and planning skills to achieve both personal and project goals.
