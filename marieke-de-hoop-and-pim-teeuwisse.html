                    Marieke and Pim delivered an inspiring talk in which they shared their journey from design to building digitally accessible websites, apps, and software. Together, they have developed a strong focus on accessibility, with Marieke, a former Communication & Multimedia Design (CMD) student, already fascinated by this topic during her studies.
                    <br><br>
                    They began by highlighting the crucial distinction between temporary and permanent disabilities, and how these affect the user experience. Marieke emphasized the importance of truly empathizing with various disabilities, including cognitive impairments, to understand who might be excluded by inaccessible digital products.
                    <br><br>
                    The core of their presentation revolved around the definition and principles of digital accessibility according to the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). These guidelines encompass "The Big Four": perceptibility, operability, understandability, and robustness.
                    <br><br>
                    Perceptibility addresses whether all users can perceive the content, such as readable text and sufficient color contrast. Operability focuses on the accessibility of interactive elements, ensuring they are easy to use with different input methods. Understandability concerns clear and understandable content, where the purpose of links, for example, must be clear. Robustness refers to technical correctness and the semantic structure of content, crucial for interoperability with assistive technologies like screen readers.
                    <br><br>
                    Marieke and Pim encouraged avoiding technical jargon and focusing on practical measures, such as testing accessibility with a screen reader and conducting keyboard navigation tests. They stressed the importance of iterative improvement based on feedback from the target audience and adapting designs that do not perform well in terms of accessibility.
                    <br><br>
                    Their presentation was not only educational but also inspiring, encouraging listeners to adopt an empathetic approach in designing and developing digital products aimed at being accessible to everyone. Marieke and Pim's story powerfully illustrates how deep engagement with accessibility can lead to more inclusive and effective digital experiences.
