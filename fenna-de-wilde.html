                    Fenna de Wilde gave an inspiring presentation on the importance of accessibility in the industry, highlighting that it is still often not well implemented. She shared valuable insights and practical tips for making software and websites more accessible to all users, regardless of their limitations.
                    <br><br>
                    Fenna began with the importance of keyboard navigation, noting that not every user uses a mouse. She emphasized the need for a clear focus state for keyboard users, such as a visible focus indicator or a global focus state, like a red outline, indicating which element the user is on. This is often achieved using the pseudo-class in CSS.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, she explained how ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) can enhance accessibility. She mentioned specific attributes such as aria-label for describing elements, aria-controls to indicate relationships between different elements, and aria-expanded to communicate the status of collapsible elements. She also stressed the importance of aria-live settings (such as polite and assertive) for live updates to screen readers, and how aria-atomic can be used to show only relevant updates.
                    <br><br>
                    Another crucial point Fenna raised was avoiding aria-hidden on interactive elements and correctly announcing list items so that screen readers can accurately interpret the content. This included using aria-controls to link previous and next buttons in carousels and other interactive components.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, Fenna discussed some general design principles for improved accessibility, such as using a minimum font size of 16 pixels, ensuring sufficient color contrast between text and background, and limiting line lengths to 50-75 characters for better readability. She also recommended using CSS units like ch for setting maximum widths and reducing animations for users sensitive to motion.
                    <br><br>
                    In summary, Fenna de Wilde's presentation not only emphasized the technical aspects of accessibility but also underscored the importance of inclusive design in the digital industry. Her insights will undoubtedly contribute to creating a more accessible and usable digital world for everyone.
